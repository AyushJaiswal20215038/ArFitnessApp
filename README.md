# Exercise with AR

It is a web-based AR application that allows users to imitate various poses.
I used 2D images due lack of 3D model and their price.

- I used Ar js and Ar frame libraries for Ar implemantation.

- User have to put a marker at some distance by checking test model. After adjuting it little they can use it.
